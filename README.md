# VITRA Monitoring App

For testing purposes and monitoring of a **Vitra** Database.

You will need to `git clone` and `npm link` the vitra project first!

<https://github.com/pfrazee/vitra>

This "monitor" is expected to be run with [the "kv-store.js" example contract](https://github.com/pfrazee/vitra/blob/master/examples/kv-store.js).

## Disclaimer

I'm a total noob with this. So bare with me while I am learning how all of this works.
